"One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me..."

        "What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."

"What must I do, to tame you?" asked the little prince.
"You must be very patient," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me-- like that-- in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day..."

"Ah," said the fox, "I shall cry."

			<br>
			</br>

"It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..."

			<br>
			</br>
"Yes, that is so," said the fox.

			<br>
			</br>


"But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince.

			<br>
			</br>
"Yes, that is so," said the fox.

			<br>
			</br>
"Then it has done you no good at all!"

			<br>
			</br>
"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added:"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."
